# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository status

Stage 1 of an 8-stage Pluribus-style 6-max NLHE poker AI. **Step B1 is done (post review-2)**: A1 left the Rust crate `poker` with all public types/methods stubbed via `unimplemented!()`; B1 added the full `[测试]` agent deliverables on top of those stubs:

- `tests/scenarios.rs` — 10 fixed scenarios driving `GameState`'s contract (smoke / 3bet-4bet-5bet / short all-in / min-raise chain / two-way & 3-way side pot / uncalled bet / BB walk / 全员 all-in / last_aggressor 摊牌顺序). All assertions encoded; bodies will only execute once B2 fills implementations.
- `tests/cross_validation.rs` — PokerKit subprocess harness (1 + 10-hand mini-batch). JSON stdin/stdout protocol; outcomes structurally bucketed (`Match` / `Diverged` / `Skipped` / `OurPanic` / `HarnessError`). PokerKit translation lands in B2 (current `tools/pokerkit_replay.py` is a B1Stub returning `ok=false + error_kind="B1Stub"` → harness records `Skipped`).
- `tests/fuzz_smoke.rs` — fuzz skeleton: uniform `LegalActionSet` field sampling + per-step invariant checks (I-001 / I-003 / I-004 / pot=sum(committed_total) / LA-001..LA-008). 1 + 10-hand mini-batch wrapped in `catch_unwind`; D1 will scale to 1M hands.
- `benches/baseline.rs` — criterion bench skeleton (eval5 single call + simulate one hand placeholders, no SLO assertions). E1 will replace `catch_unwind` wrappers with real hot-path calls and add SLO thresholds.
- `tests/common/mod.rs` — `StackedDeckRng` (D-028 Fisher-Yates 反推) + `Invariants` checker shared across the three test crates.

Build/test/lint commands are valid as of B1 closure (review-2):

- `./scripts/setup-rust.sh` — idempotent rustup install. Pins to the version in `rust-toolchain.toml` (currently `1.95.0`).
- `cargo build --all-targets`
- `cargo fmt --all --check`
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps`
- `cargo test --no-run` — compile tests. B1 ships 11 tests across 4 crates: `api_signatures` (1, A1 spec-drift trip-wire) + `cross_validation` (2 smoke) + `fuzz_smoke` (2 smoke) + `scenarios` (10).
- `cargo test` — 5 smoke pass (`api_signatures` / `cross_validation` ×2 / `fuzz_smoke` ×2); 10 `scenarios` panic in `TableConfig::default_6max_100bb` (`unimplemented!()`) until B2 lands implementation.

Step **B2** (`[实现]` agent — fill `GameState` / `LegalActionSet` / `payouts` / naive `HandEvaluator` / `HandHistory` so all 10 scenarios + 100-hand cross-validation pass) is next. Stages 2–8 source code does not exist yet.

## Documents and their authority

The four stage-1 docs form a contract hierarchy. Read them in this order before making changes:

1. `docs/pluribus_path.md` — overall 8-stage roadmap, stage acceptance gates, hardware/time budgets. Stages 4–6 thresholds are deliberately stricter than the original Pluribus path; do **not** weaken them.
2. `docs/pluribus_stage1_validation.md` — quantitative pass criteria for stage 1 (e.g. 1M-hand fuzz, ≥10M eval/s, 100k-hand cross-validation with PokerKit).
3. `docs/pluribus_stage1_decisions.md` — locked technical/rule decisions (D-001 … D-103). **Authoritative spec for implementers.**
4. `docs/pluribus_stage1_api.md` — locked Rust API contract (API-NNN). **Authoritative spec for testers.**

If a change affects a decision or API signature, you must follow the **D-100 / API-NNN-revM** amendment flow described in `pluribus_stage1_decisions.md` §10 and `pluribus_stage1_api.md` §11 — append a `D-NNN-revM` / `API-NNN-revM` entry, never delete the original, and bump `HandHistory.schema_version` if serialization is affected. Both docs have a "修订历史" subsection. Past rev entries:

- **D-033-rev1** (decisions §10) — pin "incomplete raise 不重开 raise option" to TDA Rule 41 / PokerKit-aligned semantics: per-player `raise_option_open: bool`, full raise opens for un-acted players + closes raiser, call/fold closes self only, incomplete touches no flags. Drives `tests/scenarios.rs` #3 (already-acted SB → `raise_range = None`) vs #4 (still-open BTN → `raise_range = Some(min_to=650)`). validation.md §1 第 22 行措辞同步收紧。
- **API-001-rev1** (api §11) — `HandHistory::replay` / `replay_to` return `Result<_, HistoryError>` instead of `RuleError`; `HistoryError::Rule { index, source: RuleError }` wraps the underlying rule error.

## Stage-1 workflow (multi-agent, strict role boundaries)

Stage 1 work is organized as `A → B → C → D → E → F` (13 steps, see `docs/pluribus_stage1_workflow.md`). Every step is tagged `[决策] / [测试] / [实现] / [报告]` and **role boundaries are enforced**:

- `[测试]` agent writes tests / harness / benchmarks only. **Never modify product code.** If a test reveals a bug, file an issue for `[实现]` to fix.
- `[实现]` agent writes product code only. **Never modify tests.** If a test fails, fix the product code; only edit the test if it has an obvious bug, and only after review.
- `[决策]` and `[报告]` produce or modify docs in `docs/`.

When the user asks you to do stage-1 work, identify which step (A0 / A1 / B1 / …) the task belongs to and operate within that role. The current step is the highest-numbered step whose outputs already exist in the repo — currently **B1 done (post review-2)** (10 scenarios + xvalidate + fuzz + bench harness committed; D-033-rev1 nailed "incomplete raise" semantics); **B2 has not started**.

## Non-negotiable invariants (apply to all stage-1 code)

These are repeated across the decision and validation docs because violations corrupt downstream CFR training and are nearly impossible to debug post-hoc:

- **No floating point in rules, evaluator, history, or abstraction.** Chips are integer `u64` (`ChipAmount`); P&L is `i64`. A PR that introduces `f32`/`f64` in these paths must be rejected (D-026).
- **No global RNG.** All randomness goes through an explicit `RngSource` parameter (D-027, D-050).
- **No `unsafe`.** `Cargo.toml [lints.rust] unsafe_code = "forbid"` rejects it at compile time. If you think you need it, escalate — almost certainly a design issue.
- **`ChipAmount::Sub` panics on underflow** in both debug and release (D-026b). Callers needing saturating semantics must use `checked_sub` explicitly.
- **`Action::Raise { to }` is an absolute amount**, not a delta — matches NLHE protocol convention.
- **`SeatId(k+1 mod n_seats)` is the left neighbor of `SeatId(k)`** (D-029). Every "向左" / "按钮左" reference (button rotation D-032, blinds D-022b, odd-chip D-039, showdown order D-037, deal start D-028) uses this single direction convention.
- **`RngSource → deck` dealing protocol is a public contract** (D-028). Fisher-Yates over `[Card::from_u8(0..52)]` consuming exactly 51 `next_u64` calls + fixed deck-index → hole/board mapping. Testers may construct stacked `RngSource` impls that exercise this protocol; implementation must not deviate. Any change bumps `HandHistory.schema_version`.
- **Showdown `last_aggressor`** counts only voluntary bets/raises (blinds, antes, preflop limps don't count) (D-037).
- **Short all-in does not reopen raise option** — but only for **already-acted** players. This is the most error-prone NLHE rule (D-033, **D-033-rev1**, validation §1). Per D-033-rev1 (TDA Rule 41 alignment): incomplete raises do not (a) update `last_full_raise_size` or (b) modify any player's `raise_option_open` flag. Players whose flag was `true` before the incomplete (un-acted on the prior full raise) keep it `true` and can still raise; players whose flag was already `false` (already-acted) cannot raise until a subsequent full raise reopens. `tests/scenarios.rs` #3 (`short_allin_does_not_reopen_raise`, SB-after-BTN-call) and #4 (`min_raise_chain_after_short_allin`, BTN-after-BB-incomplete) cover both branches.
- **Determinism baseline:** same architecture + toolchain + seed → identical hand-history BLAKE3 hash. Cross-architecture (x86 vs ARM) is an aspirational goal, not a stage-1 pass criterion (D-051, D-052).
- **`tests/api_signatures.rs` is the spec-drift trip-wire.** A1 stubs return `!` which unifies with any return type — wrong signatures compile silently otherwise. Any signature change in `pluribus_stage1_api.md` (via API-NNN-revM) must update this file in the same PR; otherwise `cargo test --no-run` fails.

## Engineering anti-patterns (explicit in workflow doc)

When proposing changes, do not:

- Optimize before correctness — performance lives in step E2, not B2/C2. The naive evaluator's 10k eval/s in B2/C2 is intentional (D-073).
- Pre-abstract with traits/generics "for future extension" in A1 / B2.
- Skip the cross-validation harness — PokerKit must be wired in **at B1**, not deferred to C1.
- Write all 200+ scenarios up front — B1 writes 10 driving scenarios; C1 batches the rest.
- Split into multiple crates early — single crate, multi-module until C2 stabilizes the API (D-010 to D-012).
- Assume our implementation is correct when it diverges from PokerKit. Default assumption: our bug. Only after review may a divergence be recorded as a reference-implementation difference (D-083).
